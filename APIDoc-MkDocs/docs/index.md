Gloom Haven Helper API
# Welcome

The documentation covers [API](/api/) requests

## Postman

We suggest downloading postman to format queries for quick reuse

To get started try this query

    GET /api/rooms

Which will return an aggregate of all [room](/api/rooms) information

## Rate Limiting

We don't rate limit so DDOS our servers as you please

## API Keys

Currently we don't authenticate API users... please be nice
